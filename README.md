## Usage: 
Open the password generator in your default browser and press the generate password button. Then the user can simply select the length of password you would like between 8-128 characters. Then you can select wheather you want the password to contain uppercase letters, wheather you want the password to contain lowercase letters, contain numbers and finally select if you would like special characters. When all the prompts have been selected you will be provided with a password.
